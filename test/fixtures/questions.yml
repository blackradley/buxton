Negative or adverse differential impact needs to be addressed by putting in place compensatory measures.<br/><br/> Some differential impact is intentional and can be characterised as positive action."

All opportunities to promote equality have been taken. <br/><br/> The use of supporting data and intelligence is vital to the decision taken at this stage. If you do not have sufficient evidence to make an informed decision you need to progress to a Full Equality Assessment. <br/><br/> Consultation must take place with appropriate stakeholders as part of the Equality Assessment process.

All opportunities to promote equality have been taken. <br/><br/> The use of supporting data and intelligence is vital to the decision taken at this stage. If you do not have sufficient evidence to make an informed decision you need to progress to a Full Equality Assessment. <br/><br/> Consultation must take place with appropriate stakeholders as part of the Equality Assessment process. This is to gain their perspectives on the work that is being undertaken and the services delivered.

All opportunities to promote equality have been taken. <br/><br/> The use of supporting data and intelligence is vital to the decision taken at this stage. If you do not have sufficient evidence to make an informed decision you need to progress to a Full Equality Assessment. <br/><br/> Consultation must take place with appropriate stakeholders as part of the Equality Assessment process. This is to gain their perspectives on the work that is being undertaken and the services delivered.
