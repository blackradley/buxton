questions_359:

  label: Is there anything about the Function and the way it affects individuals of different religions or beliefs which needs highlighting?
  name: consultation_faith_7
  help_text: This question asks you to identify any issues about the way in which the Function has an impact upon people from different religions or beliefs.  An issue will be where there is a differential impact.  This means that the impact on one particular group of individuals, say people from the Sikh religion, is different than for another group.  <br/><br/> Differential impact can be positive or negative.  Negative or adverse differential impact needs to be addressed by putting in place compensatory measures.<br/><br/> Some differential impact is intentional and can be characterised as positive action.
