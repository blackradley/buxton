  Impact Equality&trade; is an automated tool to help with equality impact assessments.  You have been asked to take a lead on the assessment of the activity identified above. If this is news to you, please contact 
  = link_to @organisation_manager.email, "mailto:#{@organisation_manager.email}" 
%p You will see four tabs at the top of this page. You are currently on the first of these (Home).  The Questions tab will take you through the assessment itself.  The Summary tab shows you what you have done so far.  Both of these (Questions and Summary) cannot be seen until you have completed two questions on the Activity Type screen.  To do that, click on the Activity Type tab or on the Next button below.
