      %h2 Equality Strand Questions
      %p The Impact Equality&trade; tool asks you questions under four Assessment Sections (impact, consultation, additional work and action planning).
      %p Each set of questions can apply to each of the six Equality Dimensions (gender, race, disability, religion or belief, sexual orientation, and age).
      %p The Assessment Sections and Equality Dimensions are set out as a table below.
      %p Click on the <img src="/images/icons/edit.gif" /> icon to answer the questions in that section. Click "Save" when you have finished work on a section.
      %p The section is complete when the <img src="/images/icons/cross.gif" /> turns into a <img src="/images/icons/tick.gif" />.  When all the <img src="/images/icons/cross.gif" />s are <img src="/images/icons/tick.gif" />s, you are finished!
