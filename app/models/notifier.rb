# The notifier sends out new "unique" URLs to the different users.  The users
# can then click on the link to get to the page they need to fill in.  No user
# names or passwords to remember, but quite insecure.  Then again no one 
# remembers the user names and passwords so they are a hassle.  It is all a 
# bit of a compromise between hassle and security.

# Unlike controllers from Action Pack, the mailer instance doesnâ€˜t have any 
# context about the incoming request.  So the request is passed in explicitly
# to each of the methods.
