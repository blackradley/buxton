The configuration on www.34sp.com means that everything is held in the public
subdirectory.  This looks crap when handing out new keys, so edited copys of 
the dispatch files (listed below) have been added at this level.  So the keys
can be handed out without /public in the URL.  Hopefully when this is deployed
for real these files will not be necessary and could be deleted.

dispatch.cgi
dispatch.fcgi
dispatch.rb 
.htaccess
