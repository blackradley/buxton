  <h1>Work Programme</h1>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Sales Demo
      <ul>
        <li>with www.css</li>
      </ul>

      User Evaluation
      <ul>
        <li>
          Organisation Manager - Remove links to redundant pages the pages (leaving
          summary, purpose and performance).  Change columns, all should have view,
          key and email links, which are identical.  'Last reminder' to read 'last key
          sent'.  Get some of the  statistics working on the summary page.
        </li>
        <li>
          Function Manager - New page as a kind of home page, should contain
          expanding collapsing bit which shows the complete summary of all sections.
          Also include print a function and approval check box and name field.  Menu
          provides links to the "Purpose" page (implemented) and "Performance" page
          (next task).
        </li>
        <li>
          Function Manager -  Implement "Performance" as per
          http://svn3.cvsdude.com/BlackRadley/buxton/trunk/doc/prototype
        </li>
        <li>
          All Pages - Implement the security and some error trapping, demonstrate
          that it works with some reasonable tests.  Currently any logged on user can
          manipulate the URL and edit the details for another user so "before_filter
          :authenticate" should probably check that the right user is looking at a
          page.
