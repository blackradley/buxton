Project Buxton
--------------

Project Buxton is a prototype web application for gathering information
on the impact of local authority functions on different customer groups.
The application has are three types of user:
    1. Administrators, who can create organisations (local authorities).
    2. Organisation managers, who create the list of functions the organisation performs.
    3. Function managers, who provide information about the impact of their function.

Users do not log on but are emailed a "unique" url, which takes them to
the appropriate page.

It is intended that users from each local authority will see a customised
version of the interface which appears roughly similar to their own local
authority website.
