      help: '<p>This question asks you to assess how well the Function is performing in meeting the needs of the different groups within
                  an Equality Strand.  The available answers are on a five point scale from 5 excellent to 1 poor.  As before Not sure if also an acceptable answer.</p>
                  <p>Please answer the question, identifying how well the Function is meeting the particular needs of men and women.  It may be that the Function is
                  meeting the needs of women very effectively but is not meeting the needs of men.</p>
                  <p>If the Function is not meeting the needs of either men or women because of their gender then the Function is not performing well for the Gender Equality Strand.</p>
                  <p>If you are not sure whether the Function meets the particular needs of men and women please answer not sure.  This is a perfectly acceptable answer as it is not always 
                  clear whether a particular Function meets the particular needs of men and women.</p>'
