            an Equality Strand.  The available answers are on a five point scale from 5 excellent to 1 poor.  As before "Not Sure" is also an acceptable answer.</p>
            <p>Please answer the question, identifying how well the #{fun_pol_indicator} is meeting the particular needs of #{wordings[strand]}.  It may be that the #{fun_pol_indicator} is
            meeting the needs of women very effectively but is not meeting the needs of men.</p>
            <p>If the #{fun_pol_indicator} is not meeting the needs of either #{wordings[strand]} because of their #{strands[strand]} then the #{fun_pol_indicator} is not performing well for the #{strands[strand]} Equality Strand.</p>
            <p>If you are not sure whether the #{fun_pol_indicator} meets the particular needs of #{wordings[strand]} please answer not sure.  This is a perfectly acceptable answer as it is not always 
            clear whether a particular #{fun_pol_indicator} meets the particular needs of #{wordings[strand]}.</p>'
